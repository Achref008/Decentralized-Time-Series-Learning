# Decentralized-Time-Series-Learning
This project presents a decentralized federated learning approach for time-series forecasting, where nodes collaboratively train a shared model through peer-to-peer communication. The system leverages ZeroMQ messaging and a Byzantine-robust median aggregation strategy to ensure stability and fault tolerance in distributed environments.
